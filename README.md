# Yelp Camp 
Users review and recommendations of best campsites
---
__Context__: This was a project from a Web Development Udemy course that allows users to add, edit, delete, and comment on campgrounds

__Challenges__: A few of the challenges included trying to teach myself the newer technologies since parts of the course were outdated. I also caught myself many times just copying the instructor. So I had to stop myself and really think about the bigger picture and the explanation for each piece of code when I fell into this trance of of watching and copying. 

__Results__: Implement REST architecture to map HTTP routes and CRUD functionalities. Added user authentication and authorization
